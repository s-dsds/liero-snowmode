New weapons:
------------
Sonic Wave (Jazz Jackrabbit missile pattern, passes through like incendiator)
Uzi (fast reload flamer-type gun, could maybe replace throw knife)
some kind of apocalypse rune / pixel bomb type thing?

Weapons unmodified from rere:
-----------------------------
Bazooka 
Doomsday (maybe - seems superfluous)
Flamer
Gauss Gun (maybe - could add bounce)
Incendiator
Lightning Gun
Minigun
Proxy Mine (maybe)
Rifle
Scattergun
Super Shotgun

Weapons modified from rere:
---------------------------
Acid Fan: slightly increase dmg output
Auto Shotgun: more like a scatter minigun (more ammo, more recoil, *maybe* more dmg)
Chaingun: nerf slightly
Flak Cannon: see if there's a way to get acid fan to work on it?
Grenade: buff (more range)
Grn Launcher: buff slightly (range and recoil?)
Solar Scorch: use the new one, make it usable for digging
Spikeballs: do something so you can't spam in no reload mode
Throw Knife: buff slightly

Weapons deleted from rere:
--------------------------
Chiquita Gun (bad)
Dartgun (incredibly busted)

Not sure what to do with these:
